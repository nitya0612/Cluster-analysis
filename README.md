Loan Data Cluster Analysis

Overview
This project focuses on conducting a Cluster Analysis on a sample of loan data to identify borrower segments based on customer behavior. The goal is to assist a consumer lending company in enhancing its loan portfolio management, offering personalized loan products, and improving overall customer satisfaction.

Key Objectives:
Customer Segmentation: Identify borrower groups with similar characteristics using clustering methods.
Enhanced Decision-Making: Improve loan approval efficiency, risk assessment, and customer support.
Data-Driven Strategy: Enable personalized loan offerings and targeted marketing campaigns.
Dataset

The dataset consists of 50,000 loan observations and includes variables such as:
Credit Scores: Reflecting the financial health of borrowers.
Finance Inquiries: Number of credit inquiries.
Loan Status: Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.
Collections: Indicator of missed payments and collection status.
Zip Codes & State: Location-based data.
Sample
A random sample of 500 observations is chosen from the full dataset for the analysis.

Steps for Cluster Analysis
Data Preprocessing:
Clean and prepare the data for clustering (e.g., handle missing values, normalize features).
Choosing the Clustering Method:
Apply clustering algorithms such as K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN.
Cluster Validation:
Use internal validation (e.g., silhouette score) or external validation to confirm the quality of the clusters.
Cluster Interpretation:
Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to understand borrower behavior patterns.

Recommendations
Based on the clustering results, the following recommendations will be provided:
Personalized Loan Products: Develop loan products tailored to the needs of specific borrower segments.
Targeted Marketing Strategies: Design marketing campaigns aimed at particular borrower groups for better engagement.
Improved Customer Support: Customize customer support processes to serve each segmentâ€™s unique needs more effectively.
